# Floppy-Turd
My first Unity game!  
Started with a Flappy Bird tutorial and ended up with something more interesting.  
Based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM)  
## Usage
This can be run on Windows operating machines.  
Download whole repo, unzip and run the Floppy Turd.exe file.  
Happy Flopping!
